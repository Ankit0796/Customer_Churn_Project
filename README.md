CREATE VIEW vw_ChurnData AS
	SELECT * 
	FROM prod_Churn 
	WHERE customer_status IN ('Churned', 'Stayed')

  - `vw_JoinData` (New joiners for prediction)

CREATE VIEW vw_JoinData AS
	SELECT *
	FROM prod_Churn
	WHERE customer_status = 'Joined';

## üß™ 2. Python: Machine Learning Model (Random Forest)

### üìä Goal:
To predict which newly joined customers are likely to churn using a classification model.

### üîç Key Steps:
- **Data Source:** `Prediction Data.xlsx` (from SQL export)
- **Target Variable:** `Customer_Status` (`Churned` = 1, `Stayed` = 0)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Dropped ID and non-informative columns
  - Label Encoding applied to categorical features
  - Handled missing values
- **Model:** `RandomForestClassifier`
- **Train-Test Split:** 80‚Äì20

### ‚úÖ Initial Evaluation:
- **Predicted Churners (Untuned Model):** 381
- Accuracy: ~0.81
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report generated

<img width="449" height="264" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d984bf49-bab5-41af-a89c-f6876c5beac9" />

- Feature Importance plotted (Seaborn barplot)

importances = model.feature_importances_
indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]

plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
sns.barplot(x=importances[indices], y=X.columns[indices])
plt.title('Feature Importances')
plt.xlabel('Relative Importance')
plt.ylabel('Feature Names')
plt.show()

<img width="1416" height="855" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7696fe2-60bd-4eb7-b19c-1de2493a9e22" />

- This chart ranks input features by their relative contribution to the model‚Äôs decisions. Features with higher importance scores had a stronger influence on predicting whether a customer would churn.
- Features like Tenure_in_Months, Contract Type, and Monthly_Charge were found to be most influential.
- Less important features which has relative importance less than 0.01 were considered for removal during the model tuning phase to improve generalization and reduce complexity.
- The features include 'Gender', 'Married', 'Phone_Service', 'Multiple_Lines','Online_Backup', 'Device_Protection_Plan','Streaming_TV', 'Streaming_Movies', 'Streaming_Music', 'Unlimited_Data', 'Total_Refunds', 'Total_Extra_Data_Charges'

Explain the model to non-technical stakeholders

### üõ†Ô∏è Model Tuning: Feature Reduction & Re-training

To improve model performance and reduce overfitting, less important features (based on feature importance chart) were dropped:
- Removed: `Gender`, `Married`, `Phone_Service`, `Multiple_Lines`, `Streaming_*`, `Unlimited_Data`, `Total_Refunds`, `Total_Extra_Data_Charges`, etc.
- Relative importance of remaining features

#### Re-tuning Process:
- Re-trained model with remaining important features
- Re-encoded categorical variables
- Evaluated accuracy and classification report again

#### Results:

| Model Version     | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Churn Predicted |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-----------------|
| All Features      | 85.3%    | 80.6%     | 64.5%  | 71.7%    | 381 customers   |
| Reduced Features  | 86.0%    | 80.0%     | 63.0%  | 71.0%    | 364 customers   |


- Exported prediction to: `Prediction Data tuned.csv`
- High-churn segments retained:
  - Customers with <6 months or >24 months tenure
  - Month-to-month contracts
  - Low engagement in value-added services
